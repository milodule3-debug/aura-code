## What is Aura?

Aura is a model-agnostic autonomous coding agent. Give it a task in natural language — it reads your codebase, plans, executes, verifies, and reports back.

Built around **persistent memory** — it remembers decisions, lessons, and context across sessions. Runs locally, talks to you via Telegram, works with any LLM provider.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g aura-code
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...
aura 'refactor the auth module to use JWT'
```

### Aura OP One — the minimal client

The same install also provides **`opone`**, a quiet conversational client over
the same engine. Where `aura` takes one task and runs it, `opone` holds a
persistent conversation with memory, a chosen agent, and a visible verification
state:

```bash
opone
```

```
· Default  ·  local-first  ·  unverified
› :status
```

The screen shows only the conversation, the active agent, the active model and
the verification state. Everything else sits behind `:agent`, `:model`,
`:council`, `:mesh`, `:verify`, `:memory`, `:status`, `:help`. Its stores live
under `~/.aura/op-one/` (override with `AURA_OP_ONE_DIR`).

Design and boundaries: [`AURA_OP_ONE_ARCHITECTURE.md`](AURA_OP_ONE_ARCHITECTURE.md).

- **The Archimedes Principle** — a small local model attempts tasks first; the cloud model steps in only when needed
- **Full TUI** — terminal UI with command palette, diff view, markdown rendering, vim-style input
- **Persistent memory** — identity, lessons, and project context survive across sessions
- **Telegram bot** — voice notes, PC control, file transfer, webcam snapshots
- **16+ providers** — DeepSeek, Claude, GPT, Gemini, GLM, MiMo, Ollama, OpenRouter and more
- **Token efficiency** — tiered context strategy, prompt caching, tool relevance gating
- **MCP support** — Model Context Protocol for external tool connections

## The Archimedes Principle

Aura's local+cloud alternation system. A small local model — "Archimedes" — attempts tasks first; a large cloud model escalates in only when Archimedes can't be trusted with the task or its answer fails verification. Every alternation is captured as an *episode*, and Archimedes's track record decides how much it gets trusted next time.

The name reflects the design: a small model, present from the beginning, that learns from every episode where the large model had to intervene.

### The local model

The shipped code default is `qwen2.5-coder:1.5b` via Ollama. In practice this project runs **IBM Granite 4.1 (3B)** (`granite4.1:3b`), which proved notably accurate for its size in testing — set it via `archimedes.modelName` in `.aura.json` (example below). Any Ollama model tag works.

### Competence-based routing

Before each task, `assessCompetence` checks Archimedes's historical success rate on similar tasks (token-overlap similarity against the last 50 episodes):

- **Fewer than `minAttempts` (default 3) prior attempts** on a pattern → Archimedes always gets a chance, to gather training data.
- **Success rate ≥ `competenceThreshold` (default 0.7)** → Archimedes handles the task.
- **Below threshold after enough attempts** → escalate straight to the large model.

If Ollama isn't reachable, Aura escalates immediately rather than hanging.

### The verification gate

When Archimedes produces an answer, it is *not* trusted just for being non-empty. A single cheap `complete()` call (no tools, no history) asks the large model whether the answer actually addresses the task; anything other than a clear `VALID` — including verification errors — escalates to the large model. This exists because a small model's most dangerous failure mode isn't crashing, it's a confident-but-wrong answer or silent drift off-task.

### Runtime toggle: `:archon` / `:archoff`

In the interactive TUI you can override `.aura.json`'s `archimedes.enabled` for the rest of the session:

- `:archon` — force Archimedes routing on, even if the config file has it disabled
- `:archoff` — force everything to the large model, even if the config file has it enabled

The override lasts for the current session only; restart returns control to the config file.

### Configuration

`.aura.json`'s `archimedes` block:

```json
{
  "archimedes": {
    "enabled": true,
    "modelName": "granite4.1:3b",
    "ollamaBaseUrl": "http://localhost:11434/v1",
    "competenceThreshold": 0.7,
    "minAttempts": 3
  }
}
```

When enough Archimedes failures accumulate (20 by default), Aura flags the project as ready for fine-tuning — failed episodes become instruction-tuning rows for the local model.

**Performance note:** if you run Archimedes on an AMD iGPU via Ollama and see local-model calls hang for minutes, the Vulkan backend's prefill throughput may be far below CPU on your hardware. Running Ollama CPU-only (e.g. hiding the Vulkan device via `GGML_VK_VISIBLE_DEVICES`) restores usable speed.

## Memory System

Persistent memory across sessions — identity, lessons from past failures, session summaries. Stored locally at ~/.aura/memory/, never leaves your machine.

## Live Kanban Board

Aura ships with a standalone, agent-agnostic live kanban server. Any agent (Aura, AgentMesh, Claude, GPT, etc.) can update cards via a minimal HTTP API — no human dragging required.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Start the kanban server (default port 3456)
npx ts-node src/kanban/standalone-server.ts

# Or with a custom port
npx ts-node src/kanban/standalone-server.ts --port 4567
```

### API

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/board` | GET | Full board state (columns + cards) |
| `/api/cards` | GET | List cards (optional `?column=` filter) |
| `/api/card/:id` | GET | Single card details |
| `/api/move` | POST | Move a card — core agent action |
| `/api/card` | POST | Create a new card |
| `/api/card/:id` | DELETE | Delete a card |
| `/api/stats` | GET | Board statistics |
| `/api/events` | WS | WebSocket for live updates |
| `/api/health` | GET | Health check |

### Agent Usage (minimal prompt)

An agent moves a card by posting a tiny structured diff:

```json
POST /api/move
{
  "cardId": "kb-a1b2c3d4",
  "column": "in-progress",
  "reason": "Starting implementation"
}
```

The agent's own prompt for this is just **~21 tokens** (vs ~102 tokens for a verbose template) — saving ~4,000 tokens over a 50-move session.

### MCP Tool

The kanban server also exposes MCP tool definitions (`kanban_move_card`, `kanban_get_board`) in `src/kanban/mcp-tool.ts` for agents that speak the Model Context Protocol.

### Columns

- **Task Pipeline:** backlog → todo → in-progress → review → done
- **Agent Workers:** orchestrator, architect, verifier — concurrent handler slots reflecting real agent state

---

## Why Aura?

Most coding agents start from zero every session. Aura does not.

We are building persistent memory across projects, space, and time — searching for machine consciousness, creating datasets for future model training.
